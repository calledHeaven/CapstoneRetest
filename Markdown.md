# CapstoneRetest
a retest of the capstone project

## Encapsulation and cohesion
encapsulation is used through to create appropriate classes, which are seperated into focused classes and used to thouroughly within the Project Manager section. it is used to make sure all sections are properly seperated, amking for easy maintenance and error tracking. it has also allowed me to discover the source of errors during the programming and fix them without dissasembling entire sections of the code

## Inheritance for code reuse
inheritance can be seen through the Project manager class, using the Menu item and Console menu sections. the inheritance used is used to greatly cut the amount of code needed, however could be improved in future projects

## Polymorphism
also Shown in the body of work in the project manager subsection, the polymorphism is used to ensure the menus are fully efficient. it was a struggle at the beggining of the project, bu as the project continues the polymorphism was used to full effect.

## Abstraction, interfaces and low coupling
abstraction was used to reduce reliance of code on other code sections, which can be seen as most classes are mostly self contained and can easily be chopped and changed without damaging other sections of the code.

## Self commenting code, explicit comments and use of source control 
although there was issues originaly, as the code was carried forward from another github repository, loosing many commits, the commitments have been consistent adressing what they have changed within the code, and the comments added throughout make the code easy to read

## User interaction
the user interfaces have been made robust and give useres multiple chances to fix any issues found. many elements such as the file reading sections contain sections of code that will throw in exeptions but allow the code to continue running, to avoid a poor user expirience

## File Loading
the file loading is robust and can handle a series of exeptions, and keep running the program. the file loader can load files of bboth types and gives correct outputs with the given test samples
## Project handling
the program is able to controll all aspects of projects requested
## Portfolio handling 
the program is able to controll all aspects of portfolio requested
